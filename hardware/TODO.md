_Do I look like a man with a plan? **A limiting plan only limits you.**_

TBC = have not thought about enough yet to have a solid plan. Fill up in the future.
<ins>**_THIS IS A REMINDER TO FILL UP IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS, IF YOU CAN_**<ins>

<ins>**Mostly completed:**</ins>
- Bottom and top PCB schematics.

<ins>**Incomplete:**</ins>

**Thread 1:**
- Figure out where to place batteries (can consider different batteries if available in club room).
- CAD out bot body, including all PCB components, batteries, kicker and space for dribbler. Figure out how everything fits together.
- Create and route PCBs based on CADded positions.
- Order PCBs and components.

Thread 2:
- Design ultrasound PCB, horn and enclosure.
- (Sync with thread 1) add to main design.
- Design test ultrasound PCB with headers as well.
- Order ultrasounds, PCB, and stainless steel mesh.
- Test and iterate designs (horn, enclosure and mesh).

(TBC) Thread 3:
- Kicker prototyping

(TBC) Thread 4:
- Dribbler prototyping
