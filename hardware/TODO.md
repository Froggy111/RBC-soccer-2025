_Do I look like a man with a plan? **A limiting plan only limits you.**_

- TBC = have not thought about enough yet to have a solid plan. Fill up in the future.
  - _THIS IS A REMINDER TO FILL UP IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS, IF YOU CAN_

## Mostly Completed
- Bottom and top PCB schematics.

## Incomplete

**Thread 1:**
- Figure out where to place batteries (can consider different batteries if available in club room).
- CAD out bot body, including all PCB components, batteries, kicker and space for dribbler. Figure out how everything fits together.
- Create and route PCBs based on CADded positions.
- Order PCBs and components.

**Thread 2:**
- Design ultrasound PCB, horn and enclosure.
- (Sync with thread 1) add to main design.
- Design test ultrasound PCB with headers as well.
- Order ultrasounds, PCB, and stainless steel mesh.
- Test and iterate designs (horn, enclosure and mesh).

**Thread 3:**
- Order mouse sensors and breakout boards.
- Print the baseplate for mouse sensors.
- Test.

**Thread 4:**
- Make wheel friction testing holder.
- Test wheel friction both not under and under heavy weight.

**(TBC) Thread 5:**
- Kicker prototyping

**(TBC) Thread 6:**
- Dribbler prototyping
