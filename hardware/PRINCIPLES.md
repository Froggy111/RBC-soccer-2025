_Principles get thrown away when they are the most needed. **Stay calm and collected.**_

**AJR's opinions:**

**LJY's opinions:**
- Modular design - make everything as easily removable and replacable as possible without hurting performance and/or cost too much (use breakouts over soldering directly on, etc.)
- Adaptable design - with components that have a slow cycle time and/or expensive (PCBs, etc.), try to design redundant parts to easily change up the design when needed (spare spots for decaps, etc.) and/or allow fast cycle time and cheap adaptations to be made (3D printed adapters, etc.)
- Safe design - use cheap and/or easily/quickly replacable parts to protect expensive and/or slow to replace parts. Make designs as idiot proof as possible (because I am an idiot). Follow all usual design recommendations (e.g. minimum tolerances) plus some more.
