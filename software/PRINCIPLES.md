_Software can be well structured without slowing it down by 3 orders of magnitude. As long as you **embrace the chaos where beneficial.**_

# Principles
- Do not isolate software and hardware too much (do not abstract too much in between), such that software can adapt to hardware conditions (basically be aware of hardware while designing software)
- Reasonably minimise overhead (computational, physical and technical) in software. It will almost always come back to bite later. Do not fixate on it though, balance with time and effort spent. Use a software structure to assist with this as much as possible.
- **Ensure software is modular and easily adaptable**
- Ensure software is well documented (comments) and easy to understand
- Extract constants that could be adjusted in the future
