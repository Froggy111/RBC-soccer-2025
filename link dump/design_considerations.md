zach's motors: 140.9g each
LiPo: 200-300g

4x drive upper bound:
600g motors, 300g LiPo, 500g left

4x drive lower bound:
570g motors, 200g LiPo, 630g left

3x drive not recommended bcos
- speed: motors were already close to max speed during comp
- pushing power (currently motors are not stalled though so ??)
- try if desperate

search club room for motors

so...
idk

either ways a bit die
