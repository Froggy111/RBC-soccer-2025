ESSENTIALS:
motors: ~90g each - 360g total
LiPo (12.6V, 1300mAh): ~195g each - use 1? enough power? - probably swap batts every 10min - 98W to work with but undervolting
PCBs: probably 100(18cm dia)-150(22cm dia)g each? use 2 plates?
ultrasound: ~15g each - 60g total if 4 sides (probably shouldnt do 3 sides)
CM4 + ioboard: ~30g
OpenMV cam: ~30g
wheels: ~20g each at very least maybe? 80g total

super essential only current total:
360g (motors) + 200g (LiPo) + 200g (PCBs) + 60g (ultrasound) + 30g (compute) + 30g (cam) + 80g (wheels)
= 960g total (440g left, reasonable)
2 lipos: 1160g total (240g left BAD)
1 lipo big pcbs: 1060g total (340g left, workable?)

kicker: ~110g (might not be able to do)
