PARTS:
- ESSENTIALS
motors: ~83g each - 332g total
LiPo (12.6V, 1300mAh): ~115g each - use 1? enough power? - probably swap batts every 10min - 98W to work with but undervolting - investigate available power more
PCBs: probably 60(18cm dia)-90(22cm dia)g each? use 2 plates?
ultrasound: ~9.4g each - 40g total if 4 sides (can even consider not having?)

- if using CM4:
CM4 + ioboard: ~30g (~6.4W)

- if using RPi 5:
RPi5: ~46g (~6.4W no OC)
active cooler for RPi5: ~29g (~2W)

- if using 3 cams:
220deg wide cams: ~18g each, ~54g total
wheels: ~20g each at very least maybe? 80g total

- if using mirror:
OpenMV cam: ~18.2g (for reference)
mirror setup: ~50g

- if using kicker:
kicker: ~105g (solenoid) + 55g (capacitor setup) ~= 160g (might not be able to do)

MASS:
- RPi 5, 3 cams, 4 ultrasound (most likely setup): 332g (motor) + 115g (LiPo) + 180g (PCBs) + 40g (ultrasound) + 46g (RPi 5) + 29g (cooler) + 54g (cams) + 80g (wheels) = 876g, 524g left
