ESSENTIALS:
motors: ~83g each - 332g total
LiPo (12.6V, 1300mAh): ~115g each - use 1? enough power? - probably swap batts every 10min - 98W to work with but undervolting
PCBs: probably 60(18cm dia)-90(22cm dia)g each? use 2 plates?
ultrasound: ~9.4g each - 40g total if 4 sides (probably shouldnt do 3 sides)
CM4 + ioboard: ~30g (~6.4W)
OpenMV cam: ~18.2g
wheels: ~20g each at very least maybe? 80g total
mirror setup: ~50g

super essential only current total:
332g (motors) + 115g (LiPo) + 180g (PCBs) + 60g (ultrasound) + 30g (compute) + 30g (cam) + 80g (wheels) + 50g (mirror)
= 867g total (533g left, reasonable)
if use zachs motors, +58g per motor, 232g total, 1099g
2 lipos: 1210g total (190g left BAD) (DEFINITELY CANNOT DO)
1 lipo big pcbs: 1110g total (290g left, workable? probably need to do this anyways)

kicker: ~105g (solenoid) + 55g (capacitor setup) ~= 160g (might not be able to do)
if kicker + 1 lipo big pcbs: 1270g (130g left) (!! definitely no mass for usb accelerator (sad))

130g left is a little bit doable maybe?
