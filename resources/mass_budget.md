ESSENTIALS:
motors: ~90g each - 360g total
LiPo (12.6V, 1300mAh): ~195g each - use 1? enough power? - probably swap batts every 10min - 98W to work with but undervolting
PCBs: probably 100(18cm dia)-150(22cm dia)g each? use 2 plates?
ultrasound: ~15g each - 60g total if 4 sides (probably shouldnt do 3 sides)
CM4 + ioboard: ~30g (~6.4W)
OpenMV cam: ~30g
wheels: ~20g each at very least maybe? 80g total
mirror setup: ~50g

super essential only current total:
360g (motors) + 200g (LiPo) + 200g (PCBs) + 60g (ultrasound) + 30g (compute) + 30g (cam) + 80g (wheels) + 50g (mirror)
= 1010g total (390g left, reasonable)
2 lipos: 1210g total (190g left BAD) (DEFINITELY CANNOT DO)
1 lipo big pcbs: 1110g total (290g left, workable? probably need to do this anyways)

kicker: ~105g (solenoid) + 55g (capacitor setup) ~= 160g (might not be able to do)
if kicker + 1 lipo big pcbs: 1270g (130g left) (!! definitely no mass for usb accelerator (sad))
