_All roads lead to the formation of a society. Take a road or not, **it's your choice.**_

# Principles
- **Catch up on all aspects** (including hardware and software) **urself**.
- **No leader team structure.** Leaders are bloat and inefficient in such a small team. We can focus on different problems each, but nothing should be one man's decision. Everyone should participate in everything to reduce errors and inefficiencies. Everything should be communicated as much as possible (or at the very least, documented.)
- **Document everything well** for future reference and juniors. Focus on why over how (best to have both though).
- **Keep it centralised:** Do everything mostly in this repo - use spreadsheets when beneficial, but link to them in this repo.
