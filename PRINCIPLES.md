**ACCEPTED:**

**AJR's opinions:**

**LJY's opinions:**
- Everyone should know both the hardware and software very well, so problems can be more quickly resolved, and will learn more from doing this
- No leader team structure. Leaders are bloat and inefficient in such a small team. We can focus on different problems each, but nothing should be one man's decision. Everyone should participate in everything to reduce errors and inefficiencies. Everything should be commmunicated as much as possible (or at the very least, documented.)
- Document everything well (to best of our ability) for future reference and juniors. Focus on why over how (best to have both though)
- Do everything mostly in this repo - use spreadsheets when beneficial, but link to them in this repo. Keep it centralised.
